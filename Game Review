Game Title: Respawn

Summary

Respawn is a platformer about constant death and mistakes to get to the end of the level. A respawn triangle is given to the player and is used
to toss accross each level. Then upon death the player is respawned at the triangles location or a checkpoint.

Final Thoughts
 i would say this game was a love child of portal and super meat boy but more with more death.  the game itself provides a challengeing expierence with its uniqe game concept of throwing your respawn device and dieing to get where you need to go. it has well thought out level designs and puzzles that show alot of brilliance and creativity to keep the gameplay refreshing as the player continues through each level. the only gripes i have may just be an operator error on my part but the throwing mechanic often felt inconsistent when tossing the triangle. problems such as the triangle being launched the opposite direction my cursor is pointed and what the game indicated visually as a maximum throw end up being pityable tosses.
